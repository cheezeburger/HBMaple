MSEA Trainer v16x.x Outdated

Old MSEA trainer made back in the days. Unfortunately only the source codes can be retrieved. GUI can be added based on the source code. Codes contains flaws here and there.

Notable Features
- Trainer includes function to find end address of multilevel pointer. Accepts multiples offsets in the functions to be added to the base addy.
- Auto key which I believe is non patchable.(Unless Maple starts patching PostMessage) Uses PostMessage KeyUp and KeyDown events.
- Auto pot can be easily updated as long as pointers(TSingleton_CWvsContext) and offsets are known.
- Demonstrates the use of codecave.
